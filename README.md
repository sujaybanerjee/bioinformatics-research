This repository contains code from projects I worked on in the Stephen Chan Lab at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. 
One project involved mapping geolocation data of patients with pulmonary hypertension to the pollution to see if there is a higher propensity to develop the disease in polluted areas.
The other project involved spatial transcriptomics to measure all the gene activity in a rat lung tissue sample to map where the activity is occurring and give insight into the histology of pulmonary hypertension.
